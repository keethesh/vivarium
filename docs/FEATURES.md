# 🕷️ VIVARIUM: The Swarm Engine

> *"The colony does not ask permission. It consumes."*

## The Colony (Core Architecture)

| Concept | Hive Name | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Your Instance | **The Queen** | The central intelligence coordinating all swarm activity |
| Web GUI | **The Hexagon** | Visual command interface - because bees build in hexagons |
| Bots/Zombies | **Workers** | The distributed swarm members |
| Bot List Files | **The Comb** | Stored worker addresses, organized like honeycomb cells |
| Tor/Anonymity | **Smoke** | Beekeepers use smoke to calm and obscure - your anonymity layer |
| Updates | **Metamorphosis** | Evolution of the codebase |

## The Swarm (Bot Types)

| Original | Hive Name | Behavior Metaphor |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Zombies (HTTP GET) | **Workers** | Basic foragers, simple but numerous |
| Droids (Complex GET) | **Soldiers** | Larger, more specialized attackers |
| Aliens (HTTP POST) | **Parasitoids** | Inject payloads into hosts (like parasitic wasps) |
| UCAVs (Web Abuse) | **Hornets** | Aggressive, multi-vector strikers |
| XML-RPCs | **Aphids** | Symbiotic reflectors, farmed by the colony |
| DNS/NTP/SNMP | **Cicadas** | Amplifiers - their "calls" echo across the network |

## Stings (DoS - Single-Origin Attacks)

*Precision strikes from the Queen herself.*

| Original | Hive Name | Why It Fits |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| LOIC | **Locust** | Devours resources with overwhelming speed |
| LORIS | **Tick** | Latches on slowly, drains over time |
| UFOSYN | **Wasp** | Quick, painful TCP SYN jabs |
| XMAS | **Firefly** | Lights up all TCP flags like bioluminescence |
| NUKE | **Famine** | Starves the target of connections |
| UFOACK | **Yellowjacket** | Aggressive ACK swarm |
| UFORST | **Mantis** | Severs connections with precision RST cuts |
| DROPER | **Molt** | Sheds fragmented packets like an exoskeleton |
| OVERLAP | **Chitin** | Overlapping fragments like armored plates |
| PINGER | **Mosquito** | Constant, irritating ICMP bites |
| UFOUDP | **Fly Swarm** | Chaotic UDP bombardment |

## Plagues (DDoS - Distributed Attacks)

*The full colony, mobilized.*

| Original | Hive Name | Why It Fits |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| FRAGGLE | **Drone Chorus** | UDP echoes amplified across the swarm |
| TACHYON | **Cicada Song** | DNS amplification - one call, massive echo |
| MONLIST | **Cricket Swarm** | NTP servers chirp back en masse |
| SMURF | **Echo Chamber** | ICMP broadcast reflected back as a flood |
| SNIPER | **Termite Network** | SNMP tunnels exploited structurally |
| SPRAY | **Pollen Burst** | TCP-SYN reflected off third-party hosts |
| DBSTRESS | **Termite** | Attacks the foundation (database layer) |

---

## Senses (Reconnaissance)

| Original | Hive Name | Why It Fits |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Inspector | **Scout** | Finds the juiciest targets (largest files) |
| Abductor | **Antenna** | Detects defenses (WAFs) and weaknesses (CVEs) |
| X-Ray | **Compound Eye** | Sees all ports simultaneously |
| ShowNet | **Pheromone Trail** | Maps your local network identity |
| Crypter | **Royal Jelly** | Encrypted nectar - secure communication |

---

## Foraging (Bot Acquisition)

| Original | Hive Name | Why It Fits |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Dorking/Search | **Foraging** | Scouting the web for vulnerable hosts |
| Auto-Search | **Swarm Intelligence** | Autonomous, distributed searching |
| Blackhole (P2P) | **The Nest** | A node others can connect to |
| Grider | **Waggle Dance** | Sharing location/stats (bees dance to communicate) |
| GlobalNet | **The Murmuration** | The global swarm consciousness |
| GitHub Sync | **Migration** | Seasonal movement of worker lists |

---

## Camouflage (Evasion)

| Original | Hive Name | Why It Fits |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Proxy | **Burrow** | Hidden tunnels for traffic |
| User-Agent Spoof | **Mimicry** | Disguising as another species |
| Referer Spoof | **False Trail** | Laying misleading pheromone paths |
| X-Forwarded-For | **Phantom Scent** | Fake origin markers |
| X-Client-IP | **Ghost Wing** | Invisible source identity |
